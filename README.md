## üîí Security Considerations

- **API Keys**: Never hardcoded; always passed as parameters
- **Authentication**: Uses Microsoft Graph with proper OAuth authentication
- **Data Privacy**: No breach data is stored; reports are generated locally
- **Permissions**: Only requires read-only Graph permissions (`Group.Read.All`, `User.Read.All`)
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects API limits to maintain service availability

## üéØ Use Cases

- ‚úÖ **Regular Security Audits** - Schedule monthly or quarterly breach checks
- ‚úÖ **Onboarding Reviews** - Check new employees or contractors
- ‚úÖ **High-Security Groups** - Monitor privileged access accounts
- ‚úÖ **Compliance Requirements** - Document security monitoring for audits
- ‚úÖ **Incident Response** - Quick assessment after public breach announcements
- ‚úÖ **Executive Reporting** - Professional reports for management briefings
